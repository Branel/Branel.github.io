    <a href="CV.html">TL;DR? Visit my Résumé</a>
</h4>
<p>
My mastery within programming:<br>
C++ is my programming native tongue. I've read the most about it, been the most interested in it.<br>
I am comfortable with JavaScript as I have been using it for Minecraft custom development, mostly for my own personal use. <br>
I am comfortable with MySQL.<br>
I learned Python as a beginner and have intermediate experience, it is currently my least liked language.<br>
</p>
<p>
My proficiency outside of programming:<br>
Swedish is my mother tongue, I have high level English speaking abilities. <br>
I am creative, thoughtful, ambitious, dedicated,<br>
I like having many things going on at once so that I can constantly shift my focus to keep my productivity high.<br>
I have experience repairing computers and phones, I did it on my own time as a hobby. I have rescued too many laptops from certain death.<br>
</p>
<p>
Why I learned programming:<br>
I always liked creating my own things, whenever I use something I always wonder how I would do things differently.
I have always been interested in programming and have had small presence in custom development, but I started taking it more serious 2021, by self teaching myself, reading books and considering to pursue a education within Computer Science.<br>
</p>
<p>
My favorite parts about programming:<br>
Learning new things!<br>
Testing/Debugging, resolving issues.<br>
Be apart of a team and working together to solve a tremendous task.<br>
